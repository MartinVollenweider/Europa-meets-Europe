# Europa meets Europe
Art Project for the GLAMhack 2020
**Description**: In this art project, random images of the Galilean Moon Europe from the NASA archive are overlaid with current images from European webcams in rhythm with music (e.g. Jupiter Symphony by Mozart).

**Data**: The dynamic images of Europe are accessed via the NASA API, the webcams via the Windy API. An appropriate API for the music has to be evaluated.

**Goal**: The art project links and connects the continent of Europe with the 1610 by Galileo Galilei discovered Jupiter moon, which is around 660 million kilometers away.

**Support**: Help is sought for evaluating pieces of music and embedding them as well as for the design and layout.
